        <p class="standard">RxJS is a very useful tool for modeling data streams in your application. Almost any structure can serve as a data source, from simple values to promises to <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">EventEmitters</samp>. The most important elements of RxJS are observables, which serve as the data source; operators, which allow you to influence the data flow; and the observer, which is the destination of the data flow.</p>
        <p class="standard">To keep the set of available operators manageable, they are divided into different categories, such as creation or transformation operators.</p>
        <p class="standard">The advantage of an architecture based on RxJS is that you compose it from numerous small and mostly independent parts. In general, RxJS is platform independent, so you can use it in Node.js as well as in the frontend.</p>
