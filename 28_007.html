        <p class="standard">This chapter has introduced you to Deno, a modern alternative to Node.js. Deno is a comparatively young platform that is currently still very much outshone by Node.js. Nevertheless, Deno takes a very modern approach. You can see this simply from the fact that the core of the platform isn’t written in C or C++, but in Rust. In addition, Dahl has attempted to address the architectural weaknesses of Node.js in Deno by adding the permissions system and allowing Deno to do without an additional package manager altogether, for example.</p>
        <p class="standard">The question as to whether or not you should base your next project on Node.js or Deno isn’t an easy one. What speaks for Node.js is that the platform has proven itself in practical use over many years and is very performant and stable despite some weaknesses. In addition, a very important factor is that Node.js has the backing of a very large open-source community. Deno, on the other hand, scores with a clean and modern architecture, built-in security features, and integrated TypeScript support.</p>
        <p class="standard">You should therefore give both platforms a chance and find out for yourself which platform better helps you implement your requirements.</p>
