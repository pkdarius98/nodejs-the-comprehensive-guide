        <p class="standard">This chapter has dealt with testing Node.js applications. You can achieve a basic validation of your source code by using the unit tests presented here. They represent the first stage of testing at the function level and validate the smallest components of an application. If you combine several functions or entire workflows, this is commonly referred <a id="p682"/>to as integration testing. Integration tests differ both in the scope of functionality covered in a test and in the runtime. Integration tests usually have a longer runtime.</p>
        <p class="standard">With Jasmine and Jest, you got to know two test frameworks for Node.js. But there are also numerous other implementations available, such as Mocha, for example. This framework is similar to Jasmine, with the difference that you have to include an assertion library such as Chai and also use external libraries for spies.</p>
        <p class="standard">Basically, a test framework should allow you to group your tests, provide <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">setUp</samp> and <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">tearDown</samp> routines, and produce easy-to-read output. When it comes to formulating tests, the various frameworks usually differ only in the syntax they use. The procedure, which is usually based on the AAA pattern, is independent of the tool you’re using, so you shouldn’t find it difficult to switch to a different framework.</p>
