        <p class="standard">When using Node.js, there is no way around a package manager. However, you’re not bound to npm and can freely choose between the available alternatives such as npm, Yarn, or even pnpm because all package managers obtain the necessary data from the same base repository. The infrastructure provided by the package manager allows <a id="p639"/>Node.js developers to integrate only the essential modules and interfaces into the platform and rely on the package manager for everything else. Thus, database drivers and helper libraries don’t need to be part of Node.js itself.</p>
        <p class="standard">The fact that the npm repository is an open and free platform where every developer is allowed to publish their work offers both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that the barrier for packages is very low, which means that there is already a solution for almost every problem. One drawback is the absence of quality assurance and package control, which poses security risks.</p>
        <p class="standard">If you build your own application with Node.js, you should always use npm. In the repository, you’ll find numerous small and large packages that can save you a lot of work. Established Node.js packages also follow this strategy in order not to constantly reinvent the wheel, but to rely on proven solutions.</p>
        <p class="standard">Yarn represents an alternative to npm. The motto here is “competition stimulates business.” As a result, both Yarn and npm constantly introduce new features that benefit you as a developer.</p>
