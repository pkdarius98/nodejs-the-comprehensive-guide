        <p class="standard">In this chapter, you learned how to create a server with a REST interface that is suitable for communicating with other machines as well as with modern single-page applications. The output format here is very often JSON, which is natively supported by Express. The changes to create such a REST interface are mostly limited to the controller layer because it determines the format of the output. Unlike classic multipage applications, REST interfaces don’t use a template engine because the output isn’t in HTML format.</p>
        <p class="standard">Other requirements are also placed on a REST interface with regard to authentication. Because such an interface should basically be stateless, session-based solutions like the one you learned about in the previous chapter aren’t necessary. Instead, you should implement a token-based solution such as JWT. With the appropriate modules, the implementation effort for such a mechanism is manageable.</p>
        <p class="standard">In addition to the basic implementation of such an interface, there are other important topics, such as documenting the interface or validating the inputs, which you can integrate into your application with the appropriate packages with manageable effort.</p>
