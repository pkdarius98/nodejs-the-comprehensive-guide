        <p class="standard">In this chapter, you’ve learned that you must be economical with the resources you have. The architecture of Node.js is basically designed in such a way that it makes an application performant. The platform swaps out all operations it doesn’t need to perform itself to other services or the operating system. Its nonblocking input/output (I/O) approach also ensures that the Node.js process isn’t significantly blocked by read and write operations. The memory footprint of Node.js is also comparatively small. On this basis, it’s up to you to develop a lightweight and performant application.</p>
        <p class="standard">Node.js provides you with a lot of help for analyzing CPU and memory issues with the debugger, Chrome DevTools, and some onboard tools.</p>
        <p class="standard">In general, you should make sure that you implement your source code in a clean and readable way, and don’t use too many performance optimizations too early, as these usually impact readability. Once you’ve completed developing a feature, you should test it using realistic data and measure its performance. After that, you can start optimizing. When the optimization process is completed, you should measure again and check whether the optimizations were target-oriented. This way, you can make sure that you improve your source code exactly where the problems occur.</p>
