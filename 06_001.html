The open-source project was launched in June 2009 by T. J. Holowaychuk,<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_01"/> and its purpose is to help you develop web applications. The focus of Express is on speed, manageable scope of the core framework, and an easily extensible interface. The well-thought-out architecture makes it possible to maintain until today, and thus the framework has become an almost indispensable companion when it comes to the development of web server applications based on Node.js. Frameworks such as Express exist because web development often involves solving standard tasks. For example, in PHP,<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_02"/> there is the Symfony<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_03"/> framework; in Python,<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_04"/> you can use Django<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_05"/>; and Ruby on Rails offers a solution for web applications under Ruby. You can implement your application completely in the respective language (in this case, Node.js) without the help of further libraries and frameworks, but you lose a lot of time with the implementation of the basic infrastructure. Just remember the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">createServer</samp> callback function from the previous chapter where you had to take care of parsing the URL and performing the corresponding action yourself.</p><p class="standard">In addition to handling requests and resolving URLs, other standard tasks such as session handling, authentication, or file uploads need to be taken care of. There are already established solutions for all these tasks, which have been combined into a framework under the leadership of Express. Because of its stability over the years and its extensible architecture, Express serves as the foundation for a variety of other libraries and frameworks, such as Nest<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_06"/>, which we’ll look at in more detail in <span class="crossreference "><a href="14_001.html#h14">Chapter 14</a></span>.</p>
        <h2 class="t2" id="h6.1">6.1    Structure</h2>
        <p class="standard">Express is a compact framework with a manageable range of functions. However, it can be easily extended with middleware<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_07"/> components. The structure of Express, much like Node.js itself, is layered<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_08"/>, as you can see in <span class="crossreference "><a href="06_001.html#f6.1">Figure 6.1</a></span>.</p>
        <div class="imagebox figure-type"><a href="img-f6.1.html" id="f6.1"><img alt="Express Structure" id="img-f6.1" src="bilderklein/klein06_001.png"/></a></div>

            <a id="p178"/>Express Structure</p>
        <p class="standard">The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> module<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_09"/> of Node.js serves as the foundation for Express. The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> module creates the server process on which Express is based. In addition, the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">request</samp> and <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">response</samp> objects are available to access the request information and create the response to the client, respectively. Internally, for example, Express makes use of the URL the user has entered in the browser to implement the routing process within the application.</p>
        <p class="standard">The second layer of the Express architecture is the middleware layer. In the context of Express, a middleware is a function located between the incoming request and the server’s response to the client. Multiple middleware functions can be chained together to perform specific actions based on the client’s request. Prior to the third version of Express, Connect formed this middleware layer. In version 4, the developers abandoned this additional dependency and developed a standalone layer, which remains mostly compatible. The third layer of the Express architecture is the router<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_10"/>. This component of Express controls which function should be executed depending on the called URL to generate a response to the client. When routing, both the HTTP method and the URL path are considered.</p>
        <p class="standard">In this chapter, you’ll create a web application that allows you to manage a movie database. Before you start working on the application, you must first initialize it and install Express.</p>
