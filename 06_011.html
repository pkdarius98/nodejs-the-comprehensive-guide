        <p class="standard">In this chapter, you learned about Express, the most widely used web application framework for Node.js. Unlike the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> module of Node.js, it’s much more convenient by either completely relieving you of numerous tasks or at least making them much easier. Express is a lightweight framework that is well suited for use in both small- and large-scale applications.</p>
        <p class="standard">The Express framework provides a router that can be used to define combinations of <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> methods and URL paths and then bind callback functions to them. Routes in Express can have static and dynamic parts.</p>
        <p class="standard">The middleware components provide you with a flexible plug-in system. A middleware refers to a function that is located between the incoming request and the outgoing response. You can use these functions to implement additional features, such as logging or request body processing, and use them to process, enrich, or log the request.</p>
        <p class="standard">To extend your application, you can either use existing middleware components, such as Morgan or the body parser, or write your own components.</p>
        <p class="standard">Due to its modular design, Express can be operated not only with HTTP but also with HTTPS and HTTP/2.</p>
