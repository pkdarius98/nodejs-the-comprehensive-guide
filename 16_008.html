        <p class="standard">Throughout this chapter, you’ve learned how the Node.js platform allows you to swap out calls to external commands and even entire parts of your application from the main process to child processes or worker threads. Based on the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">child_process</samp> module, the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">cluster</samp> module enables you to start multiple server processes for Net or HTTP servers and let the operating system do the load balancing between these processes.</p>
        <p class="standard">Finally, with promises, you’ve learned a concept that allows you to better structure asynchronous calls within your source code, making it more readable. Promises are also a means of error handling in an asynchronous context. A promise represents the positive or negative result of an asynchronous operation and can be fulfilled or rejected, with fulfillment representing the success case and ensuring that the function passed to the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">then</samp> method as the first argument is executed. A rejection of a promise means a failure of the asynchronous operation and is equivalent to an exception. Due to a rejected promise, the function you passed as the second argument to the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">then</samp> method is called.</p>
        <p class="standard">As promises have established themselves in the JavaScript and also in the Node.js world, and now that core modules such as the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">fs</samp> module also offer a promise-based interface, async functions and top-level await represent the next step in asynchronous programming. These kind of functions enable you to use promises entirely without callback functions.</p>
