        <p class="standard">This chapter has introduced some facets of a microservice architecture with Node.js. You’ve learned how to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously between services, how to package services in their own containers, and how to separate them from data storage so that they can be better scaled.</p>
        <p class="standard">However, the options shown only represent the beginning of the implementation of such an application. The next steps you should take involve implementing service discovery, where you can register your services in a central location and, as a consumer of <a id="p790"/>a service, request the address of such a service. One implementation for this is Consul; a Node.js client also exists for this service, which you can use in your application.</p>
        <p class="standard">As you’ve seen in this chapter, Node.js as a platform for microservices is very flexible and can be connected to almost all interfaces. Both client and server implementations are available as Node Package Manager (npm) packages for all common protocols. When choosing the right components, you should always keep your requirements in mind and check whether the targeted solution can meet them.</p>
        <p class="standard">With the right architecture and communication channels, you’re able to scale your Node.js services as much as you want and also handle a very large number of requests. This allows you to start multiple instances of individual services and distribute incoming requests among them.</p>
