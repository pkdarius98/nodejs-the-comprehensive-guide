Kennedy</p><p class="standard">With<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_00"/> Node.js, you can achieve relatively fast results. This is one of the biggest advantages of combining a lightweight platform with a rich collection of packages. However, this high speed of development also quickly gives rise to a shortcoming: The quality<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_01"/> of the source code isn’t always the best. This is less of a problem for simple prototypes, but if you’re working on a large application that’s supposed to be used for several years, you need to pay attention to the quality of the source code. For Node.js, numerous tools<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_02"/> exist to support you with this task. In this chapter, we’ll introduce you to some style guides and tools you can integrate into your development process.</p><p class="standard">This chapter predominantly describes the static analysis of JavaScript source code. This means that the source code is checked for certain structures and patterns and doesn’t need to be run for this purpose. The idea behind this concept is that you translate your quality expectations for a software into actual metrics<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_03"/> and compare the program code with this expectation. If you perform this comparison on a regular basis, you’ll always know the current level of your software. Depending on whether or not your program code meets the standards you define, you have the option to take various measures to bring the quality to a satisfactory level and maintain it for a longer period of time.</p><p class="standard">Taking the strategy one step further, developers involved in the project aren’t allowed to commit source code to the repository that doesn’t meet the quality criteria of the application. In this context, too, there are tools to enforce such rules.</p><p class="standard">Tools for static code analysis<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_04"/> are available for almost every language, from classical languages such as C or Java to web languages such as PHP or JavaScript. In this context, there is no one tool that allows you to analyze your entire application and provides you with a summary of the quality status; instead, a number of specialized tools exist, each looking at only certain aspects. In the remainder of this chapter, you’ll learn about several of these tools.</p>
        <h2 class="t2" id="h22.1">22.1    <a id="p642"/>Style Guides<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_05"/></h2>
        <p class="standard">Consistent source code that follows a uniform standard is easier to read mainly because certain patterns are repeated and certain approaches are reused in similar situations. In addition, such coding standards contain numerous best practices that either increase the readability of the source code or help to avoid frequently occurring errors. As a developer, JavaScript gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to the design of your source code—starting with fundamental things such as indentation using tabs or spaces up to the question of whether or not a statement has to be ended with a semicolon. The placement of curly brackets is also a frequent cause of discussion in development teams.</p>
        <p class="standard">To create clarity here, you should define a style guide for your project. A number of style guides have become established for JavaScript:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">Airbnb<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_06"/> JavaScript Style Guide (<span class="url"><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">https://github.com/airbnb/javascript</a></span>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">Google<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_07"/> JavaScript Style Guide (<span class="url"><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html">https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html</a></span>)<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_08"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item">JavaScript Standard<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_09"/> Style (<span class="url"><a href="https://github.com/standard/standard">https://github.com/standard/standard</a></span>)<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_10"/></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="standard">No matter which style guide you choose or if you define your own, make sure that the rules are defined and that code examples are provided; in the best case, even short explanations should be included. A style guide is better accepted when developers understand why a particular rule should be applied.</p>
        <p class="standard">If you use a style guide, you should also continuously question its individual rules and make adjustments as the project progresses. This is especially true if it turns out that certain rules can’t be applied or can only be applied in a very poor way. In general, it’s better to choose a stricter style guide at the beginning of a project and adapt it to your needs during development. Tightening rules at a later stage often causes complex rework throughout the application, which in turn offers potential for errors.</p>
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h22.1.1">22.1.1    Airbnb Style Guide<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_11"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">As the first concrete example, the Airbnb style guide can be used for both client-side and server-side JavaScript. It defines different rules in a number of areas. <span class="crossreference "><a href="22_001.html#f22.1">Figure 22.1</a></span> contains an example of such a rule.</p>
            <p class="standard">The Airbnb style guide rule definitions consist of a short description in the headline—in this case, that semicolons should be used. The heading is followed by the name of the rule in ESLint<a class="indexanchor" id="i22_12"/>. Then follows an explanation of the rule. The individual sections conclude with a series of concrete examples. They are supposed to illustrate both how the rule is applied and what a counterexample would look like.</p>
