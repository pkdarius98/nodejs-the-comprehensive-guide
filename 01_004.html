        <p class="standard">The development history of Node.js shows one thing very clearly: it’s directly connected to the internet. With JavaScript as its base, you have the ability to achieve visible results very quickly with applications implemented in Node.js. The platform itself is very lightweight and can be installed on almost any system. As is common for a scripting language, Node.js applications also omit a heavyweight development process, so you can check the results directly. In addition to the fast initial implementation, you can also react very flexibly to changing requirements during the development of web applications. Because the core of JavaScript is standardized by ECMAScript<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_60"/>, the language represents a reliable basis with which even more extensive applications can be implemented. The available language features are well documented extensively both online and in reference books. In addition, many developers are proficient in JavaScript and able to implement even larger applications using this language. Because Node.js uses the same JavaScript engine as Google Chrome<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_61"/>—the V8 engine<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_62"/>—all language features are also available here, and developers who are proficient in JavaScript can familiarize themselves with the new platform relatively quickly.</p>
        <p class="standard">JavaScript’s long history of development has produced a number of high-performance engines. One reason for this development is that the various browser manufacturers were always developing their own implementations of JavaScript engines, so there was healthy competition in the market when it came to running JavaScript in the browser. On one hand, this competition led to the fact that JavaScript is now interpreted very quickly, and, on the other hand, it led to manufacturers agreeing on certain standards. Node.js as a platform for server-side JavaScript was designed as an open-source project<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_63"/> since the beginning of its development. For this reason, an active community quickly developed around the core of the platform and deals mainly with the use of Node.js in practice, but also with the further development and stabilization of the platform. Resources on Node.js range from tutorials to help you get started to articles on advanced topics such as quality assurance<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_64"/>, debugging<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_65"/>, or scaling<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_66"/>. The biggest advantage of an open-source project such as Node.js is that the information is available to you free of charge, and questions and problems can be solved quite quickly and competently via a wide variety of communication channels or the community itself.</p>
