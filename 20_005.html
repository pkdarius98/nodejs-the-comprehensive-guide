        <p class="standard">Throughout this chapter, you’ve learned how to submit data in several ways. As an alternative to client-server communication over HTTP, you can also use various types of sockets. These operate at a deeper level than HTTP. Consequently, you’re bound to fewer rules and conventions, but you have to implement some methods provided by HTTP yourself. In addition to network-based communication, you can use Unix sockets or Windows pipes for a file system-based transfer of data. In this case, you don’t need to bother about the overhead of setting up connections and the various network layers. However, you’re limited to having both communication endpoints running on the same machine. If you connect via the network, you can use TCP if you need a reliable connection that ensures the recipient receives all data correctly. Alternatively, you can use UDP if it isn’t critical for individual packages to be lost.</p>
