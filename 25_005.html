        <h2 class="t2" id="h25.5">25.5    Docker<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_87"/></h2>
        <p class="standard">Docker is container software<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_88"/> that manages your application in self-contained units called containers. Docker can be run on almost any system, so you only need to create <a id="p731"/>a container once and can then run it in a wide variety of environments. The big advantage of this way of running an application is that the application doesn’t run directly on the system, but in an abstracted environment isolated from the rest of the system. This increases the level of security on your system and allows you to easily scale your application by launching additional containers as needed. With Docker, you can easily test your application on different Node.js versions by swapping the underlying Docker image<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_89"/>. In addition, a Docker image can be deployed directly to the cloud, providing the foundation for flexible and highly scalable applications.</p>
        <p class="standard">Node.js manages a set of official images, which are the basic building blocks of a Docker container. The most commonly used image is the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">node:&lt;version&gt;</samp> image. This image is based on the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">buildback-deps</samp> image, which only brings a set of basic packages. The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">node:&lt;version&gt;</samp> image itself installs <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">node</samp>, <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">npm</samp>, and <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">yarn</samp> and then serves as a basis for your application.</p>
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h25.5.1">25.5.1    Dockerfile<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_90"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">Once you’ve developed your application, you can put it in a container. As a basis for this, you need a file called <span class="italic">Dockerfile</span>. This file contains the building instructions for the container. <span class="crossreference "><a href="25_005.html#l25.16">Listing 25.16</a></span> shows an example of a Dockerfile.</p>
            <div class="listing " id="l25.16"><pre>FROM node:16.8.0<br/>WORKDIR /usr/src/app<br/>COPY package*.json ./<br/>RUN npm install<br/>COPY . .<br/>EXPOSE 8080<br/>USER node<br/>CMD [ "npm", "start" ] </pre></div>
            <p class="caption "><b>Listing 25.16</b>    
            Dockerfile</p>
            <p class="standard"><samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">FROM node:16.8.0</samp> specifies the base image of your container. <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">WORKDIR /usr/src/app</samp> enables you to create a directory for your application. Then you use the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">COPY</samp> command to copy the <span class="italic">package.json</span> file and the <span class="italic">package-lock.json</span> file to that directory. After that, you install the dependencies specified there via <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">npm install</samp>. <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">COPY . .</samp> ensures that the source code of your application gets copied into the container. With <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">EXPOSE 8080</samp>, you release port <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">8080</samp>, to which your application is bound, to the outside world so that clients can connect to it. <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">USER node</samp> ensures that your application doesn’t run under the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">root</samp> user by default. Finally, <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">CMD ["npm", "start"]</samp> starts your application via the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">npm start</samp> command.</p>
            <p class="standard">To have the <span class="italic">node_modules</span> file and any generated <span class="italic">npm-debug.log</span> file ignored by the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">COPY</samp> command, you create a file named <span class="italic">.dockerignore</span>. You can see the contents of the file in <span class="crossreference "><a href="25_005.html#l25.17">Listing 25.17</a></span>.</p>
            <div class="listing " id="l25.17"><pre><a id="p732"/>node_modules<br/>npm-debug.log </pre></div>

            <h3 class="t3" id="h25.5.2">25.5.2    Starting the Container</h3>
            <p class="standard"><a class="indexanchor" id="i25_91"/>Once you’ve created the Dockerfile file, you can create the image for your container. The command required for this is shown in <span class="crossreference "><a href="25_005.html#l25.18">Listing 25.18</a></span>.</p>
            <div class="listing " id="l25.18"><pre>$ docker build -t my-app/express-app . </pre></div>
            <p class="caption "><b>Listing 25.18</b>    
            Building a Docker Image</p>
            <p class="standard">The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">-t</samp> option allows you to create a tag that assigns a name to the image. The naming convention here is to first use a unique name such as the company name followed by a <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">/</samp> and the application name. You can address the image under this name later. The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">docker images</samp> command lists all locally available Docker images. The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">my-app/express-app</samp> entry should also appear in this list after executing the preceding command.</p>
            <p class="standard">The final step consists of starting the container. This is done using the command from <span class="crossreference "><a href="25_005.html#l25.19">Listing 25.19</a></span>.</p>
            <div class="listing " id="l25.19"><pre>$ docker run -p 8181:8080 -d my-app/express-app </pre></div>
            <p class="caption "><b>Listing 25.19</b>    
            Starting the Docker Container</p>
            <p class="standard">The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">-p</samp> option ensures that port <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">8080</samp> of the container is mapped to port <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">8181</samp> of the host system and that the application is thus accessible. The <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">-d</samp> option enables you to “detach” the container, that is, to run it in the background.</p>
            <p class="standard">Now your application is available at <span class="italic">http://localhost:8181</span>.</p>
