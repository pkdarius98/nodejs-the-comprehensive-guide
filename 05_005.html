        <p class="standard">The Node.js HTTP server is one of the reasons for the success of Node.js. In just a few lines, you can implement a web server capable of delivering static content to a client. Add a few more lines, and you already have a dynamic solution that can handle data from the client and generate output based on it.</p>
        <p class="standard">If you work directly with the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> module, you should definitely make the extra effort and choose the secure variant with the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">https</samp> module. All you need to do that is a valid certificate. This means that communication between client and server is encrypted, which both increases your users’ trust in your application and improves search engine ratings.</p>
        <p class="standard">With the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http2</samp> module, the Node.js platform has been enriched by another module. This module enables contemporary applications with secure connections.</p>
        <p class="standard">However, the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> modules are in most cases only the entry point to web development with Node.js. They don’t offer enough features for implementing extensive applications, which means you have to implement a lot of things yourself. A classic example of a library that you should include in this case is the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">request</samp> package.</p>
        <p class="standard">With regard to productive web applications, it’s also better to use frameworks such as Express. These are based on the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http</samp> module or allow the integration of <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">https</samp> and <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">http2</samp>, and they enrich their functionality with additional useful features.</p>
