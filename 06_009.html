        <p class="standard">The development of Express has lost some momentum. A clear sign of this is that there hasn’t been a major release in quite some time. In the summer of 2021, version 5 of the framework was still in alpha stage<a class="indexanchor" id="i06_81"/>. Version 4 of Express was released in April 2014. Since then, the framework has received numerous minor updates. For web developers, however, this has a decisive advantage as well: Express is a very stable and thousand-times field-tested basis for your application, where you don’t have to fear that the API will change seriously.</p>
        <p class="standard">For Express 5, the developers have announced that there will be no serious changes. Some methods that have proven to be impractical or misleading over time are removed. A classic example is the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">send</samp> method with which you could send a string or a number. If a number is passed, it’s sent to the user as a status. For example, an <span class="screenelement"><a id="p209"/>Unauthorized</span> message can be sent in a quick way. However, this has the disadvantage that you have no way to send a regular number to the client. With Express 5, you accomplish this with the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">sendStatus</samp> method.</p>
        <p class="standard">Express 5, as long as it hasn’t yet been released, can be installed using the command <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">npm install express@5.0.0-alpha.8</samp>.</p>
