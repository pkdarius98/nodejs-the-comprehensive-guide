        <p class="standard">In this chapter, you’ve learned about TypeScript and Flow, as well as how you can use both with Node.js. It’s not without reason that TypeScript is becoming increasingly prevalent in the Node.js environment. Using TypeScript provides some key benefits for developers. For example, your development environment is able to give you more precise help in the form of auto-completion. It also alerts you to errors early on, namely, at a point when you’re writing the error, rather than when it’s executed in your Node.js application.</p>
        <p class="standard">But TypeScript has some disadvantages too, of course. For the development process, using this language involves additional work because the types must be distinguished in the code. More work is also required when designing individual parts of an application, as you have to think more about the types you want to use. However, this extra effort doesn’t hurt too much in most cases because you’ll have to make these considerations sooner or later anyway.</p>
        <p class="standard">Besides all these aspects, TypeScript not only extends the language core with types you can use for variables and functions but also adds more features such as generics, interfaces, and access modifiers for classes.</p>
        <p class="standard">In any case, it’s worth taking a look at TypeScript.</p>
