         <p class="standard">We hope that you enjoyed reading this book. If it met your expectations, please do
            recommend it. If you think there is room for improvement, please get in touch with
            the editor of the book: <span class="url"><a href="mailto:meganf@rheinwerk-publishing.com">Megan Fuerst</a></span>. We welcome every suggestion for improvement but, of course, also any praise! You
            can also share your reading experience via Twitter, Facebook, or email.

         <h2 class="t2" id="supplements">Supplements</h2>
         
         <p class="standard">If there are supplements available (sample code, exercise materials, lists, and so
            on), they will be provided in your online library and on the web catalog page for
            this book. You can directly navigate to this page using the following link: <span class="url"><a href="https://www.rheinwerk-computing.com/5556">https://www.rheinwerk-computing.com/5556</a></span>. Should we learn about typos that alter the meaning or content errors, we will provide
            a list with corrections there, too.

         <h2 class="t2" id="technical_issues">Technical Issues</h2>
         
         <p class="standard">If you experience technical issues with your e-book or e-book account at Rheinwerk Computing, please feel free to contact our reader service: <span class="url"><a href="mailto:support@rheinwerk-publishing.com">support@rheinwerk-publishing.com</a></span>.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">Please note, however, that issues regarding the screen presentation of the book content
            are usually not caused by errors in the e-book document. Because nearly every reading
            device (computer, tablet, smartphone, e-book reader) interprets the EPUB or Mobi file
            format differently, it is unfortunately impossible to set up the e-book document in
            such a way that meets the requirements of all use cases.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">In addition, not all reading devices provide the same text presentation functions
            and not all functions work properly. Finally, you as the user also define with your
            settings how the book content is displayed on the screen.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">The EPUB format, as currently provided and handled by the device manufacturers, is
            actually primarily suitable for the display of mere text documents, such as novels.
            Difficulties arise as soon as technical text contains figures, tables, footnotes,
            marginal notes, or programming code. For more information, please refer to the section
            <span class="crossreference"><a href="notes.html#screenpresentation">Notes on the Screen Presentation</a></span> and the following section.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">Should none of the recommended settings satisfy your layout requirements, we recommend
            that you use the PDF version of the book, which is available for download in your
            online library.
         </p>
         
         
         
         
         <h2 class="t2" id="screenpresentation">Recommendations for Screen Presentation and Navigation</h2>
         
         <p class="standard">We recommend using a sans-serif <span class="bold">font</span>, such as Arial or Seravek, and a low font size of approx. 30–40% in portrait format
            and 20–30% in landscape format. The background shouldn’t be too bright.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">Make use of the <span class="bold">hyphenation</span> option. If it doesn't work properly, align the text to the left margin. Otherwise,
            justify the text.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">To perform <span class="bold">searches</span> in the e-book, the index of the book will reliably guide you to the really relevant
            pages of the book. If the index doesn't help, you can use the search function of your
            reading device.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">Since it is available as a double-page spread in landscape format, the <span class="bold">table of contents</span> we’ve included probably gives a better overview of the content and the structure
            of the book than the corresponding function of your reading device. To enable you
            to easily open the table of contents anytime, it has been included as a separate entry
            in the device-generated table of contents.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">If you want to <span class="bold">zoom in on a figure</span>, tap the respective figure <span class="bold">once</span>. By tapping once again, you return to the previous screen. If you tap twice (on the
            iPad), the figure is displayed in the original size and then has to be zoomed in to
            the desired size. If you tap once, the figure is directly zoomed in and displayed
            with a higher resolution.
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">For books that contain <span class="bold">programming code</span>, please note that the code lines may be wrapped incorrectly or displayed incompletely
            as of a certain font size. In case of doubt, please reduce the font size.
         </p>
