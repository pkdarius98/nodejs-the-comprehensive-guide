        <h2 class="t2" id="h25.2">25.2    Tool Support</h2>
        <p class="standard"><a class="indexanchor" id="i25_44"/>In a deployment process, there is much more to do in most cases than just copying files from one location to another. For example, before a deployment takes place, the project tests should be run and the source code analyzed. Whatever tools you use, you should automate their execution so that the deployment process requires as little effort from you as possible. The lower the hurdle of a deployment, the more often it can be done, which should be the goal for a modern application. To help you with this work, various tools are available.</p>
        <p class="standard">A few years ago, the deployment process of JavaScript applications was dominated by build tools such as Grunt<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_45"/> and gulp<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_46"/>. Although these tools are still being used today, they have become much rarer. One reason for this is that modern single-page applications are mostly built by bundlers such as webpack. Webpack features a modular architecture that allows you to integrate different plug-ins to perform different tasks in the build process<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_47"/>, such as translating TypeScript to JavaScript or integrating CSS code.</p>
        <p class="standard">On the server side, the world has also changed. Most tasks are formulated as lightweight npm scripts triggered by build pipelines. The benefit of this is that the build process becomes much simpler and the controller is no longer part of the application and its source code.</p>
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h25.2.1">25.2.1    <a id="p721"/>Grunt</h3>
            <p class="standard">Grunt is a plug-in-based task runner that can be controlled via a central configuration file. Grunt itself doesn’t solve any of your problems yet. For this purpose, you need to install various plug-ins such as the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">grunt-contrib-copy</samp> plug-in, which allows you to copy structures in the file system, or <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">grunt-contrib-clean</samp> to delete files or directories. The official project website can be found at <span class="url"><a href="https://gruntjs.com/">https://gruntjs.com/</a></span>. In addition to a step-by-step guide to help you get started with Grunt, it contains many other useful resources, such as a comprehensive list of available plug-ins.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h25.2.2">25.2.2    Gulp<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_48"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">You already learned about gulp as a build system in <span class="crossreference "><a href="18_001.html#h18">Chapter 18</a></span>, where we talked about a concrete example of using streams. The approach of gulp differs fundamentally from that of Grunt. Whereas in Grunt, you configure, in gulp, you program. Gulp considers all tasks as data streams that mostly receive files as input, modify their contents, and write them to files in turn.</p>
            <p class="standard">For the implementation of a similar example as the one that uses Grunt, refer to <span class="crossreference "><a href="18_001.html#h18">Chapter 18</a></span>. Both the installation and the setup of individual tasks are covered there.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h25.2.3">25.2.3    Node Package Manager<a class="indexanchor" id="i25_49"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">In <span class="crossreference "><a href="21_001.html#h21">Chapter 21</a></span>, you saw that it’s possible to specify different <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">scripts</samp><a class="indexanchor" id="i25_50"/> under the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">scripts</samp> section in the <span class="italic">package.json</span> file. These scripts can also be used to automate tasks. A typical example of this is the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">npm test</samp> command to execute the project tests. But numerous other commands are also possible.</p>
            <p class="standard">The following sections describe how you can now deal with the preceding information if you find that after deployment, your application isn’t able to cope with the volume of data or the number of requests.</p>
