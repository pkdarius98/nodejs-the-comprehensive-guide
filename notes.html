         <p class="standard">You are reading this e-book in a file format (EPUB or Mobi) that makes the book content
            adaptable to the display options of your reading device and to your personal needs.
            That’s a great thing; but unfortunately not every device displays the content in the
            same way and the rendering of features such as pictures and tables or hyphenation
            can lead to difficulties. This e-book was optimized for the presentation on as many
            common reading devices as possible.
