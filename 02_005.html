        <p class="standard">To develop Node.js applications, you should always use the latest version of the platform. In this context, you can be pretty sure that the vast majority of available packages are executable and tested. You’ll also get bug fixes and security updates<a class="indexanchor" id="i02_93"/> as well as access to the latest features. In most cases, it’s not worth compiling Node.js from the source code itself because ready-made packages already exist for most operating systems. The advantage of an installed package is that it can be easily updated and easily removed from the system.</p>
        <p class="standard">If it isn’t possible to use the latest version in your application because major updates aren’t readily available, you can access the LTS versions of Node.js. In these versions, the supply of updates and bug fixes is ensured for a longer period of time.</p>
        <p class="standard">With tools<a class="indexanchor" id="i02_94"/> such as nvm, it’s also possible to run multiple versions of Node.js simultaneously on one system. This becomes particularly relevant when you’re creating libraries for Node.js to support multiple versions of the platform.</p>
        <p class="standard">If you do get Node.js from the Node.js download page, make sure you don’t just download the <span class="italic">node.exe</span> file. This doesn’t include the package manager you’ll need in most cases to develop your application. You should always use the appropriate installer for your system.</p>
