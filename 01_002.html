        <h2 class="t2" id="h1.2">1.2    Organization of Node.js</h2>
        <p class="standard">The community behind Node.js has learned its lessons from the past. For this reason, there are no longer individuals at the helm of Node.js, but a committee of several people who steer the development of the platform.</p>
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.2.1">1.2.1    Technical Steering Committee</h3>
            <p class="standard">The technical steering committee (TSC) is responsible for further developing the platform. The number of members of the TSC isn’t limited, but 6 to 12 members are targeted, usually selected from the contributors<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_42"/> to the platform. The tasks of the TSC are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Setting the technical direction of Node.js</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Performing project and process control</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Defining the contribution policy</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Managing the GitHub repository</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Establishing the conduct guidelines</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item">Managing the list of collaborators</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="standard">The TSC holds weekly meetings via Google Hangouts to coordinate and discuss current issues. Many of these meetings are published via the Node.js YouTube channel (<span class="url"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation">www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation</a></span>).</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.2.2">1.2.2    Collaborators<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_43"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">Node.js is an open-source project developed in a GitHub repository. As with all larger projects of this type, a group of people, called collaborators, have write access to this repository. In addition to accessing the repository, a collaborator can access the continuous integration<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_44"/> jobs. Typical tasks of a collaborator include supporting users and new collaborators, improving Node.js source code and documentation, reviewing pull requests<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_45"/> and issues (with appropriate commenting), participating in working groups, and merging pull requests.</p>
            <p class="standard"><a id="p38"/>Collaborators are designated by the TSC. Usually the role of a collaborator is preceded by a significant contribution to the project via a pull request.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.2.3">1.2.3    Community Committee<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_46"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">As the name implies, the Community Committee (CommComm) takes care of the Node.js community with a special focus on education and culture. The CommComm coordinates in regular meetings, which are recorded in a separate GitHub repository (<span class="url"><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee">https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee</a></span>). The CommComm exists to give the community a voice and thus counterbalance the commercial interests of corporations.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.2.4">1.2.4    Work Groups<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_47"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">The TSC establishes various work groups to have specific topics addressed separately by experts. Examples of such work groups include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Release</span><br/>This work group manages the release process of the Node.js platform, defining the content of the releases and taking care of LTS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Streams</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i01_48"/><br/>The streams work group is working to improve the platform’s Stream API.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Docker</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i01_49"/><br/>This work group manages the official Docker images of the Node.js platform and ensures that they are kept up to date.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h1.2.5">1.2.5    OpenJS Foundation<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_50"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">The OpenJS Foundation forms the umbrella for Node.js development. Its role is similar to that of the Linux Foundation<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_51"/> for the development of the Linux operating system. The OpenJS Foundation was founded as an independent body for further developing Node.js. Its list of founding members includes companies such as IBM, Intel, Joyent, and Microsoft. The OpenJS Foundation is funded by donations and contributions from companies and individual members.</p>
