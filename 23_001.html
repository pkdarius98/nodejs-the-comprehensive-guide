He can also see that A was wrong. <br/>—Bertold Brecht</p><p class="standard">Automated<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_00"/><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_01"/> testing is the key to a reliable application. Tests are primarily used to validate existing functionality. This allows you to ensure that you don’t affect any existing features as you continue to develop your application. In addition, unit tests also perform well when existing source code is refactored.</p><p class="standard">Unfortunately, applications are still far too rarely secured with tests. One reason is that the effort required to create tests is often unnecessarily high. For this reason, one of your goals should be to keep the effort required to test your application as low as possible. Node.js, or rather the Node.js community, supports you in this with numerous tools, some of which you’ll get to know in this chapter.</p><p class="standard">In this chapter, you’ll learn how to write unit tests for your application, which tools you can use, and how to structure your tests.</p>
        <h2 class="t2" id="h23.1">23.1    Unit Testing<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_02"/></h2>
        <p class="standard">A unit test is used to ensure the functionality of a function within your application. This means that unit tests are applied at the functional level and secure the smallest components of your application, that is, the basis, as it were. When creating unit tests, you should follow a few basic rules, or unit test requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Isolate tests from one another<br/></span>You should formulate your unit tests in such a way that they are isolated<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_03"/> from each other. This means there should be no dependencies between the tests, and no test is based on another test.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Use one test case per test<br/></span>Note that only one test case<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_04"/> should be covered per test. A test is only responsible for a specific set of facts. If a test fails, you know exactly why.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Don’t require manual intervention<br/></span>Unit tests don’t require manual intervention<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_05"/> to run. The only interaction you should have with your tests is starting them and reviewing the results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Document your tests<br/></span>Unit tests document<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_06"/> your software. Always write your tests in such a way that <a id="p656"/>another developer reading them can infer from them how you expect the interfaces to be used within your application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Apply quality standards<br/></span>The extent to which the quality standards<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_07"/> apply to your application should also apply to your unit tests. Unit tests live as long as the actual source code of your application. And like application code, the code in your tests should evolve over time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Test relevant code<br/></span>Only test code that is actually relevant<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_08"/>. Getter and setter methods that don’t contain any logic other than reading or setting object properties don’t necessarily need to be tested.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Run tests often<br/></span>During development, run your unit tests very often<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_09"/>. This entails the requirement that the tests proceed quickly to provide quick feedback<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_10"/> to you about the state of your application.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="standard">When creating unit tests for your application, you also need to store them somewhere. There are several strategies for this.</p>
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h23.1.1">23.1.1    Directory Structure<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_11"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">No matter which approach you choose to store your tests, you should always make sure that you apply it consistently to all tests in your application. The most common variants are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Separate tests</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_12"/><br/>In this case, you store your tests in a directory structure in a separate directory, usually named <span class="italic">test</span>. With this approach, your tests can be immediately found by any viewer, and they are cleanly separated from the source code. The tests should be stored in a similar structure as the actual source code files, as this makes it easier to find the tests for the respective functionality.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="standard first-item last-item"><span class="bold">Tests with the source code</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_13"/><br/>Another approach is to save the tests in a separate file, but store the file directly with the source code you’re testing. Supporters of this variant argue that the tests can be easily and directly found, and the developer is reminded to update the tests as well when updating the source code.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="standard">The source code of the Node.js platform itself has also been tested, based on the first approach. The tests are located in a directory structure within the <span class="italic">test</span> directory<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_14"/>.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h23.1.2">23.1.2    Unit Tests and Node.js<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_15"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">The Node.js platform tests are created using the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">assert</samp> module<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_16"/> of Node.js. A good approach to learn the correct formulation of unit tests in Node.js with the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">assert</samp> module is to download the source code of the Node.js platform (available on GitHub at <a id="p657"/><span class="url"><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">https://github.com/nodejs/node</a></span>) and take a look at the tests in the <span class="italic">test/parallel</span> and <span class="italic">test/sequential</span> directories. Here, tests exist for almost all modules and features of Node.js, which on the one hand ensure the quality of the platform and on the other hand document the use of the respective functionality. You can run the tests by calling the test files via the <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">node</samp> command. <span class="crossreference "><a href="23_001.html#l23.1">Listing 23.1</a></span> shows how you can launch one of the tests for the HTTP server.</p>
            <div class="listing " id="l23.1"><pre>$ cd test/parallel<br/>$ node test-http-server.js<br/><br/>$ </pre></div>
            <p class="caption "><b>Listing 23.1</b>    
            Running Node.js Tests</p>
            <p class="standard">As you can see in <span class="crossreference "><a href="23_001.html#l23.1">Listing 23.1</a></span>, the test doesn’t generate any output, which isn’t bad in this case, as it means that the test was successful. If an error occurs, an exception gets triggered, and you’ll see a corresponding stack trace.</p>
        
        
            <h3 class="t3" id="h23.1.3">23.1.3    Arrange, Act, Assert<a class="indexanchor" id="i23_17"/></h3>
            <p class="standard">If you want to create a unit test yourself, you always follow the same procedure. The first step involves providing the correct environment for the test. This process is called <span class="italic">arrange</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_18"/> and usually involves instantiating objects and setting certain values that are prerequisites for testing. The second step consists of the actual action with effects you want to test. This phase of a unit test is called <span class="italic">act</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_19"/>. Toward the end of a test, you only need to check if the action returned the desired result. This is called an <span class="italic">assert</span><a class="indexanchor" id="i23_20"/>. <span class="crossreference "><a href="23_001.html#f23.1">Figure 23.1</a></span> illustrates this arrange, act, assert (AAA) process.</p>
