         <p class="standard">Fun fact about us: Rheinwerk Publishing has branches in both Bonn, Germany, and Boston,
            Massachusetts. The benefit of this international setup is that we can publish both
            German-language books and English-language books—the challenge is translating them.
            
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard">When our colleagues at Rheinwerk Verlag in Bonn publish a book that we would also
            like to provide to English-speaking readers, or vice versa, the manuscript undergoes
            the translation process. This means that either the author, or a third party, must
            translate every sentence, diagram, and piece of code. However, receiving the translated
            manuscript several months later isn’t the end of the story. Both the author and the
            editor must review and fine-tune the manuscript: the author ensures no errors have
            been introduced, and the editor realigns any variations in our formatting standards.
            Then, the copyeditor edits each chapter line-by-line to polish the grammar and style
            in the book’s new language. 
         </p>
         
         <p class="standard"><span class="italic">Node.js: The Comprehensive Guide</span> is one of these translations, brought to you from its fourth German edition. Ironically,
            the topic of this book, Node.js, is the solution for this “translation” process in
            the programming world. Node.js allows your client- and server-side scripts to be written
            in a single language: JavaScript. In these pages, you’ll find the instructions and
            practical examples you need to make the most of the Node.js environment for unified
            web application development.

            the best they can be. Please feel free to contact me and share any praise or criticism
            you may have.
