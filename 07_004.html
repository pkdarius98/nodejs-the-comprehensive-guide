        <p class="standard">In addition to the Pug and Handlebars engines presented here, numerous other implementations exist for Node.js. Another template engine also frequently encountered is Embedded JavaScript (EJS)<a class="indexanchor" id="i07_78"/>. As the name suggests, this is a comparatively simple yet flexible engine that has a flatter learning curve than Pug and is slightly more flexible than Handlebars. Like Handlebars, EJS uses HTML as a template language<a class="indexanchor" id="i07_79"/>. Instead of the double curly brackets, <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">&lt;%</samp> and <samp class="listingcharacter listingcharacter">%&gt;</samp> are used here as markers. The integration with Express is similarly smooth as with Pug. You can find the EJS project site at <span class="url"><a href="https://ejs.co">https://ejs.co</a></span>.</p>
        <p class="standard">Template engines are an indispensable tool that allows you to separate the view from the logic of your application. Templates not only encapsulate HTML but also allow you to insert dynamic content. By dividing your application into smaller components in an intelligent manner, you can achieve reusability in your templates, which significantly increases the maintainability of your application and can greatly reduce the effort required to create new pages. Many template engines also offer additional features such as mixins or helpers, which you can use to extend your application with your own tools that you can in turn combine into libraries and also use across application boundaries.</p>
        <p class="standard">If you only need the basic functionality of a template engine in your application, such as support for variables, loops, and conditions, you should consider using a lightweight engine such as Handlebars. However, as soon as you want to map more extensive templates and more complex structures, you should use an engine such as Pug, which leaves almost no wishes unfulfilled when it comes to template engines.</p>
        <p class="standard">Plug-ins for development environments such as WebStorm or Visual Studio Code exist for most common template engines, so you’re supported here in terms of autocompletion and syntax highlighting.</p>
