        <p class="standard">The focus of this chapter was the problem of how to get your application onto the target system—starting from the simplest form of deployment, to copying the source code, to deployment via npm. The second part of this chapter dealt with ways of handling increased data and user traffic in your application. The options range from local scaling via available processor cores to managing your own infrastructure behind a load balancer to deploying your application in the cloud.</p>
        <p class="standard">With Docker, you've learned another way to deploy your application in a controlled environment. Such containers can be booted in any environment and can be easily scaled by booting additional application containers.</p>
