        <p class="standard">With real-time-enabled applications, you can achieve impressive results. Such applications feel almost like classic desktop applications to the user. The interaction is direct and can also be actively initiated by the server. The server here has the ability to actively communicate with clients and send messages if relevant information is available.</p>
        <p class="standard">There are now many technologies for implementing a real-time web application. The WebSocket API in particular has become increasingly popular in recent times, as it’s built on its own very lightweight protocol and is finding its way into more and more browsers as part of HTML5. With Socket.IO, you’ve also learned about a library that works around one of the biggest drawbacks of the WebSocket API: WebSockets aren’t available in many older browsers. Socket.IO contains a fallback mechanism to other technologies, such as AJAX long polling, which allows a server to communicate with older browsers. Based on the practical example of a simple chat application, you’ve seen how you can use WebSockets for bidirectional communication and how Socket.IO can also be integrated instead as an alternative technology.</p>
