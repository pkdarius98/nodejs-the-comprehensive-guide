        <p class="standard">For many years now, Node.js has been an integral part of web development. In this context, Node.js isn’t just used to create server applications but also is the basis for a wide range of tools—from the bundler webpack to tools such as Babel and the compiler for CSS preprocessors<a class="indexanchor" id="i01_153"/>. The success of the platform is based on several very simple concepts. The platform is based on a collection of established libraries, which together create a very flexible working environment. Over the years, the core of the platform has always been kept compact, offering only a set of basic functionalities. For all other requirements, you can use the npm to integrate a wide variety of packages into your application.</p>
        <p class="standard">Although Node.js has now been proven in practice for several years, you may still frequently hear the following question: Can I safely use Node.js for my application? In the versions prior to 0.6, this question could not be answered in the affirmative in good conscience because the interfaces of the platform were subject to frequent changes. Today, however, Node.js is much more mature. The interfaces are kept stable by the developers. The LTS version was created for use in enterprises. This is a Node.js version that is supported by updates for a total of 30 months. This increases the reliability of the platform and takes the pressure off companies to always update to the latest version.</p>
        <p class="standard">A thoroughly exciting chapter in the development history was the separation of io.js because the development of Node.js had lost its momentum, and no innovations entered the platform for a long time. This event was a crucial turning point for the development of Node.js. The Node.js Foundation was formed, and responsibility for development was transferred from an individual to a group. As a result, release cycles and versioning were standardized, signaling both reliability and continuous further development to users of the platform.</p>
        <p class="standard">By deciding to delve deeper into Node.js, you’ll be in good company with numerous enterprises large and small around the world that are now strategically using Node.js for application development.</p>
